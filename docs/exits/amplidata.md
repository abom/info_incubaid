# Founded in 2008

Founded by Incubaid in 2008 to resolve data storage limitations. At that time storage was very slow & expensive and non scalable at all.

Amplidata’s primary offering is Himalaya, an advanced object storage software product that enables scale-out software-defined storage systems. By delivering industry leading scalability with the efficiency, resiliency, and flexibility required for demanding cloud data center environments, Amplidata’s products and technology have earned the trust of leading OEMs and cloud service providers.

Amplidata was one of the first most scalable object storage systems in the world. Amplidata could fit petabytes of data in 1 rack in a datacenter and could do this at a cost a fraction of others. The software is ultra reliable and was used by major companies in the world to store their large archives.

## Exit: 2015

Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ: WDC) acquired Amplidata to support strategy to expand into higher value storage platforms and systems that deliver breakthrough value and scalability to address the massive growth in storage requirements in cloud data centers.
