# IT as Energy
Incubaid is ThreeFold Tech’s in-house incubator. The company supports various technology startups that develop software in different technology domains, such as blockchain, mobile, storage and cloud. The ultimate vision is to make the Internet more efficient and green, and ultimately deliver IT as Energy to individuals, businesses and society.

## IT equals Energy

Energy was the primary driver for the industrial revolution(s). We believe that IT Capacity will be the energy source that drives the next industrial revolution - hence IT = Energy.

Today the reliance on IT for our businesses and society is as important as electricity. Like electricity, we believe IT capacity should be local, always available and transparently priced for everyone. Also like any other energy source, it is important that our IT capacity should be produced in a green environmentally-friendly way.

We believe IT capacity should be generated and consumed on local grid networks - just like electricity.



## IT as Energy

Incubaid and ThreeFold Tech produce raw capacity in the form of compute, storage and transaction building blocks that combine to run any IT workload. These so-called “cloud units” operate similarly to kilowatts of electricity - in the sense that they can be dynamically allocated to our customers as needed.

ThreeFold Tech’s IT as Energy concept allows transparent pricing and trading of IT capacity similar to electricity - enabling much more efficient utilization to keep up with exponential demand.

The team of Incubaid is here to support your technology-led initiatives and startups that are sharing the same vision and look to work with us and add value towards a green, friendly and democratized Internet.
